Neighbourhood Map - Eateries in Ponsonby
===============================

The task was to create a web application, showing locations on a Google map within a predefined neighbourhood. Using third party APIs (Google Streetview and Foursquare) I'm providing a list of locations and more details about the location in the map marker info window.

## How to use the application?

Simply use the [application online](http://thomasbergernz.github.io/jaffa-map), or 
[download](https://github.com/thomasbergernz/jaffa-map/archive/master.zip) to your computer and expand the ZIP archive.
Open the included 'index.html' file in a web browser.

Select a list item or a marker to see more details. Use the input field to filter/search across the locations name, category and address fields.
